With my first project outside of course tasks, I wanted to do a quick rock-paper-scissors console game. 
The player has the option to play a single game against the computer or continue and play best out of 3.

**A bit about the game itself**

In a rock-paper scissors game, the two players have the option to choose either rock, paper or scissors. 
The winner is chosen with the following logic: Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper and paper envelopes rock. 

I have implemented the following possibilities in my version of this popular game: 

| Player's Choice | Computer's Choice | Result |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
|       scissors  |        scissors   |  draw  |
|       scissors  |         rock      |  loss  |
|       scissors  |        paper      |  win   |
|       rock      |        rock       |  draw  |
|       rock      |        paper      |  loss  |
|       rock      |        scissors   |  win   |
|       paper     |        paper      |  draw  |
|       paper     |        scissors   |  loss  |
|       paper     |        rock       |  win   |
